# Contributing Guidelines

- If you would like to make a pull request, please ensure that your code is maintainable and has low or reasonable cognitive complexity. If I am unable to understand what your code is doing, I will be unable to maintain it. I hope you understand.

- Please do not just change the syntax just for the purpose of "best practices". For example, `if foo == false` to `if !foo`. Unless it makes a difference such as in performance, etc.

- Ensure that your updated code **runs**.
